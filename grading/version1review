General comments:
Glad to see you've taken a stab at test cases.
In exception tests like testGetValueFromNoExistKey,
move the fail as the last statement within try.
Also, catch a more specific exception than Exception type.

Don't place multiple asserts in one test. Instead write
separate tests.

You have written tests on the mocks. That makes no sense.
Mocks help test other pieces of code and there should be
no reason to write tests on the mocks. ModelTest.php is
strange for that reason.

Design: What I like and what needs to be improved:

getValueObjectFromPDOResultRowArray method is a smell.
Can you use polymorphism and eliminate the series of
if conditions?

I fail to see why fetchValueFromArray would be a
method on a controller? How does it make the controller
cohesive. What does a controller have to do with
getting stuff from an array? And is it an array or
more of a hashmap? It appears that this method
could go into a later below or at least be private.                        

Code quality:
Any reason why DateField can't use DateTime class?
