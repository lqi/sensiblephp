For your project, as next step focus on stabilizing features and
improving the design and code quality. Here are the things I like
to get from you:

1. Working code you have developed until the deadline (see below).
2. Value of A, I, and D' for each package and overall (feel free to use
        any tool like JDepend, NDepend, ... or hand calculate)
3. Code coverage numbers (you can integrate a coverage tool that can
        be run on your code so we can see the coverage result). This will
        tell how much of your code is tested.
4. A short writeup (check it in to docs directory) of principles and
        patterns you have used (do not use principles or patterns for
        the sake of reporting as a wrong use will affect your grades).
        Explain in few words where you used and why?
5. During the schedule demo time on November 30th: 
    Show the project features and also mention the what you are proud of and 
    what you think needs to be improved. The format is free, but I would much 
    rather hear you and see the demo of your project than look at 
    powerpoint slides.

Deadline for code and report is November 30th 5:30PM (you will not be able
to check in anything to your project repository after this time)

If you have any questions, please let me know.
